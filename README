JSONRPClib
==========
This library is an implementation of the JSON-RPC specification.
It supports both the original 1.0 specification, as well as the 
new (proposed) 2.0 spec, which includes batch submission, keyword
arguments, etc.

It is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

Installation
============
To install:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

To use this module, you'll need a JSON library. The library
looks first for cjson, then for the built-in JSON library (with
default Python 2.6+ distributions), and finally the simplejson
library.
